Hi ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien, a student passionate about learning and exploring the field of ergonomics (and software development). I love studying how small changes can significantly impact usability.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in user interface and optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how people interact with interfaces and the best practices to enhance usability.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in following and learning from projects that focus on user experience and interface improvements.
- ðŸ§ª I want to learn and experiment with advanced techniques based on research.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love climbing, cycling

Eager to learn and grow my knowledge !
